            <h2>Why do this webpage looks so dull and colorless ?</h2>
            <p>Because that's what <em>I believe</em> webpages are supposed to be. </p>
            <p>
                This thought struck me when I going through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MDN docs for HTML</a>. I couldn't help but notice that the
                whole purpose of the Web is to transfer and display information in a readable format to the end user.
                The HTML tags and its purposes made me feel like these functionalities belongs to an app to write a
                book! <br />
                I believe we, engineers and designers are overcomplicating, and bloating the web with unwanted designs
                and functionalities, and we should make the information simple and straightforward for the reader as
                much as possible. We are living in an age, <a
                    href='https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic' rel="noreferrer noopener"
                    target="_blank">where over 55% of the internet users are using mobile devices</a> who are used to
                reading plain text without unwanted distractions.<br />
                By the above statement I'm not overruling the aesthetics that might be important in a web page, but the
                fact that those need not be used in every page in existence, for example, in a portfolio website like
                this.
            </p>
            <p>The web has became more than a medium to read and write information, and have transformed into being full
                fledged apps with the advent of cloud computing. Since the users are humans, like every other creation,
                UX matters. But we can still do our part to make things simpler.</p>
